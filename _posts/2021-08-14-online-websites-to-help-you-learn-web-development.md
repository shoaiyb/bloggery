If you are looking to learn web development online, there are more than enough resources out there to teach you everything you need to know. In fact, many (if not most) of the web developers in the world today have launched successful careers by learning web development online from scratch. But even the most ambitious self-starters run into the problem of deciding where to begin.     
Below you will find my picks for the top 5 websites to help you learn web development online.     



## Why Learn Web Development Online
As a web developer, your credibility is more about the strength of your portfolio than it is about your credentials.     
Your employment opportunities will often come from concrete skills and samples of your work rather than a degree from a university.     
It’s not that a proper college education isn’t important or valuable as a web developer. Rather, it’s to say that if attending a university isn’t in the cards, you can learn everything you need to know about web development online.     
The web development industry continues to grow exponentially so you won’t find a shortage of resources.     
The most important thing to do is start.     

This list should help.     



### Codecademy

<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Codecademy</a> is a course-based online learning site that provides a unique hands on approach to learning code.     
To start learning, you must select a path (like web development). Each path includes lessons that begin with the basics and ends with advanced practical application. Each lesson includes written instructions that help you write out actual code that progresses with each lesson.     
It is a nice “learn by doing” approach that one does at their own pace.

They also offer what they call Codecademy Pro Intensives to take your learning to the next level by providing programs that will deliver job-ready outcomes. For example, you can build real-world projects and get professional developer feedback.     


### Pluralsight

You can even choose learning paths to help guide your learning experience, but they also have stand-alone courses as well.
